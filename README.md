# MIDI4CV-Module
An Arduino-based MIDI-to-CV synth module to control up to four independent pitch voltages. 
Please notice that there are 2 different MIDI-to-CV sketches. The first one (MIDI4CV.ino) is the original sketch version. It allows the selection of a user definable number of voices (up to 4), but has a lot of fundamental functions still to be coded. The second one (MIDI4CD4Voice.ino) has a fixed number of voices (4) but way more functions implemented (voice priority, gate retrigger. This last version is the one I use in my synthesizer.
